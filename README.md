# -S4-Demo-Menger-Fractal
Graphic programming project for the university made in C with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and [GL4D API](https://github.com/noalien/GL4Dummies), focusing mainly on the [Menger Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge) and animated by music.

This project aims to show what you can do in graphic programming while making something artistic. As part of the [API8](https://api8.fr/) contest, this demo was played for the purpose of participating.

If you are a french speaker, I invite you to check the code comments for more details.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [GL4D API](https://github.com/noalien/GL4Dummies)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [SDL Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) & [SDL Mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) dependencies

## How to use - *Linux Project*

### Compilation for both versions

Compile the program with ```make```.

### Utilisation

Lauch the binary as ```./DEMO```.

### Clean files

Clean object files and binary by ```make clean```.

## Exemple of Execution

Here is some picture that illustrate execution (video will come soon):
